# What this is about
This is a very basic CMS that allows you to create web pages based on page elements. You can choose to store the page elements in files or in the database. Pages and page names will be stored in the database so that filenames and directories will be emulated.

# Technical implementation
PHP and MySQL Database, HTML and CSS for Backend Interface

# Future ideas
Maybe there will be a RESTful API
